  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <div class="instructions-text-box">
    <p>
      For this assignment, we were asked to choose a software program we were familiar with and
      create an instruction manual that teaches someone how to complete a task within that software.
      I chose GitHub because it is a platform widely used in computer science and because learning
      how to use it early provides long-term benefits for managing code and collaborating on
      projects. 
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal was to help new users understand the basics — creating an account, setting up a
      repository, uploading files, and navigating the interface. GitHub stores projects inside
      repositories, which function like online folders, allowing students to organize and share
      their work safely. While working on the first draft, I kept the steps too broad, combining
      multiple actions into a single instruction. Through revision, I learned the importance of
      breaking each step down clearly so beginners don’t get confused, especially when they have no
      prior knowledge of the platform. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I also realized that writing good instructions means thinking carefully about the tools a user
      will need. Since GitHub is accessed through a web browser, students must have a computer, a
      stable internet connection, and a browser they are comfortable using. Including this in the
      instructions made the guide more practical and easier to follow for first-time users.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      While writing this assignment, I tested my instructions by having someone else attempt the
      steps. My roommate looked over what I was doing and wanted to try it himself. I sent him my
      draft once I finished, and he followed the steps exactly as written. Seeing a real person use
      my instructions helped me identify what worked well and what needed improvement — something I
      wouldn’t have noticed by reading the instructions alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project taught me several lessons about clarity, simplicity, and the importance of
      anticipating user mistakes. The warnings section of my instructions emphasized keeping login
      information secure, avoiding the upload of sensitive files, and carefully choosing whether a
      repository should be public or private. Learning these details helped me better understand the
      responsibilities that come with using GitHub. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this assignment improved my ability to teach technical skills and think from the
      perspective of someone using a tool for the first time. Creating step-by-step instructions,
      identifying potential issues, and including troubleshooting advice helped me grow as both a
      communicator and a learner. These skills will be useful as I continue working on software
      projects and helping others understand digital tools.
