      At the start of this project, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. I had never done primary
      research before, and I wasn’t very familiar with the United Nations Sustainable Development
      Goals, especially Goal #4, which focuses on providing fair and equal access to quality
      education. Once I began learning what UNSDG #4 represents and how our topic connected to it,
      the project became much more clear and interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      My group and I chose to focus on how artificial intelligence can support equal access to
      education, particularly by helping students with different learning needs. According to our
      research, AI tools can personalize lessons, simplify materials, adjust reading levels, create
      translations, and provide audio support for students who struggle with language or
      accessibility barriers. At the same time, we learned that AI cannot solve every issue related
      to educational inequality—problems such as poverty, conflict, lack of devices, or limited
      internet access require broader social and political solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working on this project as a group taught me the importance of communication and
      responsibility. We had to stay organized, divide the work evenly, and meet our deadlines. The
      collaboration process helped me see how valuable teamwork is and allowed me to understand
      different perspectives as we discussed the role of AI in education.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our survey results showed that many students use AI for explanations or tutoring, especially
      when they encounter difficult topics. Students also mentioned using AI to simplify information
      or tailor study material to their learning style. This aligned with our findings on intelligent
      tutoring systems—AI can analyze learning patterns, identify weaknesses, and create personalized
      paths that help students succeed. However, we also noted challenges such as bias, privacy
      concerns, device limitations, and the need for teacher training to properly integrate AI in
      classrooms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this project helped me strengthen my research skills and gain a deeper understanding of
      how technology—especially AI—plays a growing role in modern education. I learned how to evaluate
      academic sources, collaborate effectively in a group, and connect research to real-world
      problems. More importantly, I recognized both the potential and limitations of AI in addressing
      global educational challenges. This experience gave me valuable insight I can apply to future
      academic and professional projects.
